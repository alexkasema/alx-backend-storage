# Redis basic
* Open source in-memory data structure store which can be used as a database and/or a cache and message broker.
* NoSQL key/value store
* Supports multiple data structures
* Built in Replication (master-slave)
Redis has a client-server architecture and uses a request-response model. This means that you (the client) connect to a Redis server through TCP connection, on port 6379 by default. You request some action (like some form of reading, writing, getting, setting, or updating), and the server serves you back a response.

There can be many clients talking to the same server, which is really what Redis or any client-server application is all about. Each client does a (typically blocking) read on a socket waiting for the server response.

The cli in redis-cli stands for command line interface, and the server in redis-server is for, well, running a server. In the same way that you would run python at the command line, you can run redis-cli to jump into an interactive REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) where you can run client commands directly from the shell.

First, however, youâ€™ll need to launch redis-server so that you have a running Redis server to talk to. A common way to do this in development is to start a server at localhost (IPv4 address 127.0.0.1), which is the default unless you tell Redis otherwise. You can also pass redis-server the name of your configuration file, which is akin to specifying all of its key-value pairs as command-line arguments
## exercise.py
Writing strings to Redis
Create a Cache class. In the __init__ method, store an instance of the Redis client as a private variable named _redis (using redis.Redis()) and flush the instance using flushdb.

Create a store method that takes a data argument and returns a string. The method should generate a random key (e.g. using uuid), store the input data in Redis using the random key and return the key.

Type-annotate store correctly. Remember that data can be a str, bytes, int or float.
## exercise.py
Redis only allows to store string, bytes and numbers (and lists thereof). Whatever you store as single elements, it will be returned as a byte string. Hence if you store "a" as a UTF-8 string, it will be returned as b"a" when retrieved from the server.

In this exercise we will create a get method that take a key string argument and an optional Callable argument named fn. This callable will be used to convert the data back to the desired format.

Remember to conserve the original Redis.get behavior if the key does not exist.

Also, implement 2 new methods: get_str and get_int that will automatically parametrize Cache.get with the correct conversion function.
